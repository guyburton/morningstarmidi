Morningstar MC6 II Programmeer

The Morningstar MC6 II is programmed using MIDI sysex commands for which no documentation exists. 
Some systex commands such as bank up/down are replicable with MIDI CC messages according to https://morningstar-engineering.github.io/MC6-MKII-Midi-Controller/site/09-midi-implementation/
Other commands such as downloading and uploading patches and banks are not available. 

Use the below information for whatever purpose you like, remember that since Morningstar do not document this protocol it is subject to change with a firmware update without notice!
If you republish this information it is always nice to receive credit (but it's not mine to begin with). If you're building something cool, let me know!
